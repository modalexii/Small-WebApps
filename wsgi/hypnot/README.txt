Hypnot is a simple blogging CMS written in python for mod_wsgi. It should not be used by anyone, ever, because I knew very little about web apps and very little about python when I wrote it. Furthermore, it was never really finished. That being said, it does work.

It makes use of flat files instead of databases. This is kind of weird.

Supports multi-user authentication, but there is no authoring or accountability. Yeah.

The style sheet needs some love, to say the least.
