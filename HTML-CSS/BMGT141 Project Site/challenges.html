				<p><strong>Discrimination challenges supervisors because everyone is an individual with a certain uniqueness to them.</strong> Since everyone is different, certain
				accommodations may have to be made. Companies use peoples creativity and uniqueness to help sell products, come up with new ideas, shape their future, and much more. Employees have so much more to offer to large corporations than what their salaries cover, so accommodations are more than adequate but sometimes hard to fulfill.</p>

				<p>First of all, what is a supervisor?  May discrimination claims are brought against employees who do not fall within the traditional definition of supervisor, that is, those with the ability to hire and fire.  On November 26, 2012 the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Vance v. Ball State University.  In this case, Vance argues that her claim of discrimination falls under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 even though the offending party, who annoyed her with racial taunts and veiled threats, did not have that authority. As Justice Kagan commented in possible support of broadening the interpretation, “Professors don’t have the ability to fire secretaries, but professors do have the ability to make secretarial lives living hells.”  If the Court follows through on this broadened interpretation, it is not only traditional “supervisors” who will need to be trained in the requirements regarding non-discrimination.</p>

				<p>Discrimination can arise from violation of a federal or state statute or regulation or from violation of the employer’s own regulations. Supervisors seeking to protect themselves from discrimination claims may want to suggest to senior management that company policies reflect only mandatory protections. However, this must be weighed against the desirability of reflecting broader community standards of protection.</p>

				<p>Supervisors must be familiar with state and local requirements that may trip them up and lead to loss of legal claims. For instance, in December 2011 the Howard County, Maryland County Council passed legislation prohibiting discrimination based on [trans]gender identity and expression, including in employment.  Howard County also exceeds the state’s requirements by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of physical appearance.</p>
				<br />
				<p><strong>Gender ~ </strong> As a supervisor, it can get quite challenging to lead your team because we live in such a diverse workplace.  With more than two-thirds of women convinced that gender discrimination is bound to happen in addition to the complexity of minority classifications, the risk of experiencing a discrimination case is high for a Supervisor. </p>

				<p><strong>Religion ~ </strong> Religion is hard to accommodate because it is so broad. Employers need to take the necessary steps to observe religious holidays, garments, and general beliefs. Prayer breaks need to be considered. The bigger religions like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are familiar to most people in the United States, and may be easier to manage than less common religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shinto. It is easy for a manager to discriminate by accident for not knowing enough about an employee’s culture. Supervisor’s should be well aware  and knowledgeable of the needs of their employees. </p>
				<br />
				<p><strong>Discrimination of all kinds happens on a daily basis</strong>, but many instances do not come to be reported and many that should not be reported, are. Today people try to take advantage of the laws and their actions and use it against their supervisor. Some, just because they are not happy at work, try to find a way to accuse their supervisor of discrimination, sexual harassment, or a similar offence. This puts a lot of pressure on supervisors and presents a difficulty for how to approach to the certain people. They need to watch what they say and who they pick on. It is just enough to ask somebody to do something which employee can interpret as a discrimination.</p>
