						<td>Racial discrimination is among the most difficult forms to identify and prove. After all, unless an employer specifically admits otherwise, who can say for sure why they made a particular decision to hire a certain individual or gave another a promotion? That said, there are some instances where an employer may display some discriminatory intent.
						For example, when it comes to interviewing, employers typically should not ask questions about a prospective employee's race. If an employer does so, and decides not to hire this employee, it may serve as evidence that race played a role in the decision. Such circumstances are rare, however, and it should also be noted that employers may permissibly ask about race in the context of forms and affirmative action programs, so long as they play no part in the decision-making process. <br /><br />
						More often, discrimination is far more subtle, and an individual will have no certainty as to why they weren't hired, unlike the example above. Asking the employer is an option, but employers could offer any viable reason that is not based on race. However, it may be possible to use hiring trends as evidence of racial discrimination. Alternatively, if a lesser-qualified individual is hired or promoted to a position than an employee or applicant of another race, this could also be used as evidence of discrimination. <br /><br />
						Lastly, employers may be discriminating and not even realize it! Some employers institute hiring practices, tests, or workplace policies that single out or have a greater effect on certain races. If not done for a legitimate business purpose or properly validated, such practices could be considered racial discrimination should a claim be raised. <br /><br /></td>
						<td></td>
						<td>Gender discrimination is a very real concern in the workplace.  Some of the scenarios surrounding gender discrimination claims derive from biased promotions, workload differences, wage gaps or decrease in pay as well as sexual harassment.  Federal Law protects women and minorities from discrimination in the workplace - the Equal Pay Act of 1963 brought into law that women should get paid as much as men for the same work done. The Civil Rights Act one year later included minorities.  Nonetheless, according to TNS surveys more than two-thirds of women surveyed still feel discrimination in the workplace is happening and not all minorities are protected under law.  <br /><br />
						The concept of sexual orientation discrimination is much newer than any other types of discrimination.  In fact, in some states discrimination based on sexual orientation is not protected under law.  However, as more cases of discriminatory practices are brought to the courts, the interpretation of “sexual orientation” or “sexual identity” is constantly changing.   <br /><br />
						Prior to January 16, 2003 when the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act (SONDA) was finally passed into law, it was legal in the state of New York to hire or fire someone based on their sexual orientation. As of 2012, more than 20 states including Maryland and DC have laws to protect gay, lesbian and transgendered employees from being discriminated against, but most states do not yet support hear these cases.  A Supervisor must know the laws of their state including the Civil Rights Acts and EDNA.  The ACLU provides a substantially good website for public information and the latest legislation regarding sexual orientation.  Sexual orientation discrimination is currently being assessed and reassessed so not only does a supervisor have to know the current laws but employers should offer training for supervisors at least once a year or when necessary to keep them updated.  </td>

						<td>Who's Protected From Age Discrimination?<br /><br />
						While many people think in terms of age discrimination as it relates to older employees, the fact is that Ageism may involve a young employee as well. Age bias has to do with thinking that the calendar age of the individual will in some manner limit the ability of the individual to perform his or her work responsibilities effectively. While there are legal age limits that prohibit persons under a certain age from entering the full time job market, age limitations that are imposed to prevent a young person with the proper work and educational credentials from being considered for a job or position is considered to be unethical and if proven can also be grounds for litigation.<br /><br />
						Consequently, The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),  broad ban against age discrimination also specifically prohibits: statements or specifications in job notices or advertisements of age preference and limitations. An age limit may only be specified in the rare circumstance where age has been proven to be a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ); discrimination on the basis of age by apprenticeship programs, including joint labor-management apprenticeship programs; and denial of benefits to older employees. An employer may reduce benefits based on age only if the cost of providing the reduced benefits to older workers is the same as the cost of providing benefits to younger workers.</td>
						<td></td>
						<td>Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, retaliation occurs when an <i>adverse action</i> is taken solely because the object opposed or reported an unlawful employment practice, such as sexual harassment. This action only qualifies as retaliation if it alters an employee's' compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment. Examples include firing, demotion, reassignment, and denial of benefits or promotion.
							<br /><br />There are three basic steps to prove a retaliation case:
						<ol>
							<li>You took part in investigating or opposing an unlawful act;</li>
							<li>You suffered negative employment action, such as firing or demotion; and</li>
							<li>There is a causal connection between the two (a short time span between the original complaint and firing or demotion is sufficient proof of causation)</li>
						</ol>
						Being retaliated against in these ways is considered discrimination, but the time frame is incredibly important in proving retaliation discrimination - an employee who hesitates or attempts to ‘wait out’ this mistreatment may find themselves unable to argue that their maltreatment constitutes discrimination.

					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Religious discrimination occurs when an employee is treated differently than their co-workers based on the religious group they belong to, or when an employer refuses to make <i>reasonable accomodations</i> for a religious need upon request, unless the requested accomodations would cause an <i>undue hardship</i> for the organization. <br /><br />Common Accomodations include:
						<ul>
							<li>Allowing religious attire</li>
							<li>Providing access to meals that meet dietary provisions</li>
							<li>Permitting display of symbolic items</li>
							<li>Providing a time and place to pray</li> 
						</ul>
						Both preferential and inferior treatment constitute discrimination. Furthermore, providing religious accommodations for some may result in accusations of favoritism, or discrimination against others. Consistency in message and action is the best  way to avoid these negative repercussions. 
						</td>
						<td></td>
						<td>There are dozens of additional classes; nearly any human characteristic, no matter how trivial, could be the object of workplace discrimination. A quick Internet search turns up claims of discrimination based on
						<ul>
							<li>previous incarceration (convicts)</li>
							<li>marital status</li>
							<li>disability</li>
							<li>Income, or perceived wealth</li>
							<li>Place of birth or residence </li>
							<li>Accent or language fluency</li>
							<li>Hair, skin or eye color</li>
						</ul> 
						...and much more. Some of these types of discrimination can be particularly difficult to identify, bring to light, and resolve because they are lesser-known and may not be explicitly mentioned in the pertinent legislation.</td>
