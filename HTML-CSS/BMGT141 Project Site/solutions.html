							By remaining fair and consistent and sticking to a written policy, a supervisor can combat workplace discrimination. In addition, by posting the written policy for all employees to easily have access to, you will build the moral and trust of your employees.  Open communication  is key here.  The more that the written policy is emphasized and the more freely your employees feel they can communicate their discrimination concerns within the company,  the less likely will there be cases under your supervision and the more likely gender and minority cases can be resolved internally.  Gender and minority discrimination cases are quite unique and most challenging in that we work in a diverse workplace and the risk of violation claims are high.  A good written policy, and good leadership are good tools to use to avoid claims. <br /><br />
							See an <a href="policyexample.html">example of an anti-discrimination policy</a>

							Open and honest communication is the single best way to avoid discriminatory cases.  It allows for employees to set their own tone for their workplace environment.  A good open communication policy gets everyone on the same page.  In addition, open communication empowers employees to take positive action against discriminatory acts.  The last thing a supervisor needs is to be leading a team of employees who do not feel comfortable expressing themselves because the majority of employees have something to say.  When employees do not or are not able to express themselves resentment toward management and the moral of the staff falls.  <br /><br />
							A supervisor can encourage open communication in several ways.  One of them is by providing an anonymous way.  Examples of the anoymous way are a 3rd-party hotline (see below) or a suggestion box for employees to have access too.  These two ways of open communication gives employees who are afraid to speak out in public a way to express their gripes or complaints.<br /><br />

							More and more organizations are securing independent human resources hotlines. This has a number of benefits – first and foremost, it is a contact outside of the company that is able to provide complete anonymity to the whistle blower. The hotline provides those who feel that they have been wronged with a person to talk to, usually 24/7/365, and a considerable insurance that the issue will be investigated, for if the subject company did not care to hear about incidents, it would not pay the money required to provide such a reporting service.<br /><br />

							<a href="http://hirewellnow.com/solutions/hr-hotline/" target="_blank">HireWell's HR Hotline</a> is an example of such a service.

						<td>
							The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces all laws regarding discrimination.  EEOC also provides oversight and coordination of all federal equal employment opportunity regulations, practices, and policies.<br /><br />

							The Civil Rights Act of 1991 made major changes in the federal laws against employment discrimination enforced by EEOC. Enacted in part to reverse several Supreme Court decisions that limited the rights of persons protected by these laws, the act also provides additional protections. The act authorizes compensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentional discrimination, and provides for obtaining attorneys' fees and the possibility of jury trials. It also directs the EEOC to expand its technical assistance and outreach activities.<br /><br />

							States do not stand on the sidelines when it comes to discrimination in the workplace. State legislation covering workplace discrimination is fairly widespread, and generally mirrors federal law in prohibiting discrimination based on race. The primary differences are in the procedures used and agencies contacted to make a claim of discrimination.<br /><br />

							Consequently, The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA),  broad ban against age discrimination also specifically prohibits: statements or specifications in job notices or advertisements of age preference and limitations. An age limit may only be specified in the rare circumstance where age has been proven to be a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ); discrimination on the basis of age by apprenticeship programs, including joint labor-management apprenticeship programs; and denial of benefits to older employees. An employer may reduce benefits based on age only if the cost of providing the reduced benefits to older workers is the same as the cost of providing benefits to younger workers.<br /><br />

							The primary federal laws that address racial discrimination in the workplace fall under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In large part, the section often referred to simply as "Title VII" prohibits employers from: failing or refusing to hire an employee based on their race, firing or disciplining an employee because of their race, paying an employee less or providing them fewer benefits on account of their race, failing to provide benefits, promotions, or opportunities, to an employee because of their race and improperly classifying or segregating employees or applicants by race.<br /><br />

							Along the same lines, employment agencies cannot make decisions on referrals or work assignments based on an individual's race. Labor unions and representatives cannot refuse membership or expel individuals because of their race.<br /><br />

							However, at both the federal and state level, deadlines are a key consideration. There are often strict timelines for reporting and filing claims of racial discrimination, so if you feel you have been discriminated against, do not hesitate to contact an employment law attorney in your area to discuss your situation.<br />
