				<p>Gap, Inc. and subsidiaries Old Navy and Banana Republic have been accused of a wide variety of discriminatory practices over the past two decades. Despite several attempts at prevention including a written <a href="http://www.gapinc.com/content/dam/gapincsite/documents/COBC/Code_English.pdf" target="_blank">policy</a> against discriminatory practices and a 3rd party hotline for incident reporting, the lawsuits have been neither few nor far-between. In the majority of cases, the work environment and culture appear to be the root cause of the issues, highlighting the importance of an open and welcoming line of communication and incident responce between employees. This alone is more effective than any policy or outsourced solution.</p>
				<p>The most notable accusations of discrimination are summarized below. More details on individual cases can be found in the legal documents cited.</p>
				<b>Suhad Hasan (Old Navy, 2011)</b>
				<p>Hasan, a former Old Navy employee, was continually assigned to work the fitting room at her California store despite many requests to be trained for other positions. A hijab-wearing Muslim woman, Hasan saw her non-Muslim, modern-dressed coworkers being offered more desirable front-end positions while she was kept in the back. After months of none-the-less loyal service to the clothing store, she moved to Ohio, and was promised an automatic transfer to an Old Navy location near her new residence, but upon arrival, was let go.<br /><br />
				She is certain that she received inferior treatment because of her appearance and religion, and sued Gap, Inc for religious discrimination.</p>
				<b>Joanna Laxton (Old Navy, 2003)</b>
				<p>Laxton, an experienced retail manager, was hired to be the general manager of a new Old Navy location. After she was hired in March, she found out that she was pregnant and would need to take maternity leave around the holidays, and mentioned it to her boss, who became visibly angry. From that day on, Laxton was treated poorly and given citations for various trivial breaches of company policy such as propping the back door open, failing to inform the regional office that she had taken a sick day, and exceeding the $75 discretionary spending policy by spending $85 of pizza for employees. She was given a final written warning just one day before her termination.<br /><br />
				Laxton won a discrimination case against Gap, Inc, though Gap appealed on the grounds that the jury ruled based on prejudice and passion. <a href="http://www.osattorneys.com/pdf/Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Read the case</a>.</p>
				<b>Patricia Leahy (Old Navy, 2008)</b>
				<p>More than 30 years after the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, women still face challenges.<br /><br />
 				Leahy, a stock supervisor at Old Navy, requested permission to not be required to climb ladders or lift heavy objects during the final months of her pregnancy. She was harassed, pressured to withdraw her request, and later fired.</p>
				<b>Kelly McCulskey (Banana Republic, 2003)</b>
				<p>McCulskey worked her way through the ranks to become store manager, all the while maintaining a spotless record. On several occasions she made inappropriate comments to a male employee, who filed a compliant. McCulskey admitted to making the comments and apologized, but was later let go. She sued Gap, Inc for gender discrimination, citing eight male employees holding a variety of positions at area stores who were given only written warnings for arguably more severe incidents of sexual harassment. <a href="http://www.mass.gov/mcad/documents/Kelly%20McCluskey%20vs%20Gap,%20INC.pdf" target="_blank"> Read the case</a>.</p>
				<b>Multiple Plaintiffs (The Gap, 1999)</b>
				<p>Five former employees of a Gap in Tennessee claimed in court that they were denied promotions and faced a hostile work environment on account of their race. Gap, Inc settled with the group in 2003, awarding them $538,000 in damages.</p>
